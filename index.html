		<h3 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;">History</h3>
		<p>English Bulldogs are a breed of dogs that originated from England. They are descendents
		of mastiffs. They have been around for many centuries. As history states, they were used for
		bringing down bulls during bull fighting using their strong jaws and upper body strength. 
		In modern day, they are used as family pets or even school mascots such as UGA.</p>
		
		<h3 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;">Phyiscal Features</h3>
		<p>English Bulldogs have some very unique physical features that makes them 
		such beautiful dogs. They are a medium sized dogs with short front legs and back legs
		tho their front legs are slightly bowed out giving them a wide stance. Another unique 
		physical features that they have is the huge short-faced head with wide set shoulders
		that gives off the appearance of strength. Most have big black and brown eyes tho
		there are some that have blue eyes. Their nose is typically inward instead of outward 
		like most dogs are. The reason is because of how their face bone structure is shaped. 
		They have short fine shiny coat that can be in the colors that are shown below in
		the table.</p>

		<h3 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;">Temperament</h3>
		<p>Most people when they think of english bulldogs, they think they are mean and 
		aggressive dogs. But in reality, they are very sweet, compassionate, gentle, and loving
		dogs. The only time they get really aggressive is when they are feeling threatened or 
		when their family member is being threatened or in danger. They are fiercely loyal to 
		their owners and protect their family. Most english bulldogs are not very active dogs.
		They are very laid back dogs and typically can be left to their own selves. However,
		they do like to play some during the day like go outside, play chase, or even wrestle 
		too. They make a good family dog.</p>
